# Poems

Here are a collection of simple poems to learn how to use git.

## Getting Started

For this project we are recommending to clone this repo directly rather than fork.
A quick search about [forks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6286571/are-git-forks-actually-git-clones) explains why hacknight is going to use
this approach. 

-1 `git clone https://github.com/hacknightlbc/poems.git`
-1 `cd poems`
-2 `git checkout -b <<your_name_or_anything>>/<<branchname>>`
-3 make some changes to a file or create a new file
-5 `git add your new file or edited file` 
-6 `git commit -m "this message tells the readers something useful"`
-7 `git push --set-upstream origin your_name_or_anything/branchname`
