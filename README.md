# Poems

Here are a collection of simple poems to learn how to use git.

## Getting Started

For this project we are recommending to clone this repo directly rather than fork.
A quick search about [forks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6286571/are-git-forks-actually-git-clones) explains why hacknight is going to use
this approach. 

1. `git clone https://github.com/hacknightlbc/poems.git`
2. `cd poems`
3. `git checkout -b <<your_name_or_anything>>/<<branchname>>`
4. make some changes to a file or create a new file
5. `git add your new file or edited file` 
6. `git commit -m "this message tells the readers something useful"`
7. `git push --set-upstream origin your_name_or_anything/branchname`

If you have trouble pushing to the repo please [Contact Us](https://hacknightlbc.github.io/contact.html) and request to be a collaborator or ping us on the #hacknight [slack channel](http://j.mp/uncoded-slack)

Next time we will go to the next step where you can merge new members' work.
